{{< grid_words text="Sculptober is an event in the 3D community that is hosted every october with the goal of making a render using mostly sculpting tools. Sculpting differs from normal 3D modelling because you're kneading a 3D mesh into a shape without taking the topology of the 3D object into account. During Sculptober, a prompt is given every day, and I participated for the prompts Spy and Loss.<br><br>For Spy, I was inspired by the image of an eye looking through a key hole (i.e. spying on someone), so I combined an eye and a key, but in a different way. For loss, I found the loss of a pet quite fitting.">}}
