{{< grid_words text="Sculptober is an event in the 3D community that is hosted every october with the goal of making a render using mostly sculpting tools. During Sculptober, a prompt is given every day, and I participated for the prompts Spy and Loss. For Spy I was reminded of looking through a keyhole, and I gave a twist to that concept. For Loss, I found the loss of a pet quite fitting.">}}
