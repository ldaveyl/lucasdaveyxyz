{{< grid_words text="Sculptober is an event in the 3D community that is hosted every october (duh), with the goal of making a render using sculpting tools. Sculpting differs from normal 3D modelling in that it is more like traditional sculpting: you're using brushes to form a 3D mesh into a shape, without thinking about the topology of the 3D object. During Sculptober, a prompt is given every day. I participated for the prompts Spy and Loss.<br><br>For Spy, I was inspired by the image of an eye looking through a key hole (i.e. spying on someone), so I combined an eye and a key, but in a different way. For loss, I found the loss of a pet quite fitting.">}}
