{{< grid_words text="This scene was made for a course \"3D modelling in Blender\" at LUCA school of arts. The inspiration of this scene is the lofi hip-hop girl: a livestream on youtube of a girl listening to some relaxing hip-hop music. People watch it because it's supposed to help you study, but I just like the vibe, so I recreated the scene. The room is a mix of my current appartment and the room of my childhood. Most models in this scene were also modelled from scratch, including the laptop, screen, lamp, chair, and this of course took me an ungodly amount of time. Actually, when I was about half-way through the project I realised how cringe this was, and downloaded the rest of the models online.<br><br>Originally this was going to be an animation with the wind whipping up some loose papers on the floor but the results were rather boring, and the denoiser that I used was causing this really distracting flickering artefact. This is also around the time when I first tried a render farm because each frame took over 2 minutes of render time and by the sound of it, my poor little laptop was preparing for lift off. In the end, I captured the feeling of a sunny afternoon in my room, and my teacher let me pass the course.">}}
