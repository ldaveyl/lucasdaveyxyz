{{< grid_words text="This scene was made for a course \"3D modelling in Blender\" at LUCA school of arts. I was inspired by the lofi hip-hop girl: a livestream on youtube with a looping video of a girl listening to some relaxing hip-hop music. Somehow this is supposed to help you study. The room in this scene is a mix of my current appartment and the room of my childhood. Most models in this scene were modelled from scratch, and it took me an ungodly amount of time. When I got Half-way through the project I realised how cringe this was, so I downloaded the rest of the models (cat, the chairs on the terrace) online. I originaly made an animation with the wind whipping up some loose papers on the floor, but the results were kind of \"ehh\". This is also when I first used a render farm, because each frame took over 2 minutes of render time and by the sound of it, my poor little laptop was preparing for lift off. In the end, I captured the feeling of a sunny afternoon in my room, and my teacher let me pass the course with these renders.">}}
