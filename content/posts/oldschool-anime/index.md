{{< grid_words text="I like anime, and I grew up watching shows such as Naruto, Bleach, Death Note, and Cowboy Bebop. These shows were made in the early 2000's, and the aesthetics are very nostalgic to me. Here I tried to recreate this look by using dark blacks, a lot of glow, and a sprinkle of noise. The scene that I recreated is a 3 second clip in a Cowboy bebop episode, where they visit a casino.">}}
