{{< grid_words text=`A game jam is an event where participants try to make a game from scratch in limited time. I participated in 2 game jams hosted by LUCA school of Arts. For the first jam, the theme was "taboo", so we made a game about kidnapping: you drive around in a white van, luring little Kennies from South Park with candy, and then bringing them home (trust me, this was mild compared to the competition). There's police cars that chase you, and overall it was fun to make. I really enjoyed working on the "AI" (i.e. if see candy -> walk to candy) to lure the kids.<br><br>
The second jam didn't have a theme so we stuck with taboo and made a game about drinking alcohol ðŸ˜Ž. The goal of the game is to stay tipsy - not too drunk or too sober - by drinking water, beers, cocktails, ..., which shoot towards you from the bar. Each beverage contributes to your alcohol meter, and the longer the game goes, the faster the drinks shoot towards you so you have to be very quick. To make the game extra spicy, you play as a little girl. As I had experience with coding, I was responsible for putting together the project, while my teammates made the art and animations. The highlight for me was making the animations for the little girl respond to the alcohol meter.`>}}
