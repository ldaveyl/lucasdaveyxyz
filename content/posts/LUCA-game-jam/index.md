{{< grid_words text=`I participated in 2 game making competitions (jams) hosted by LUCA school of arts. For the first jam, themed "taboo", our team made a game about luring kids with candy. If this sounds bad, I'll have you know it was mild compared to the competition. In the game, police cars are patrolling, and you can top up on candy at the gas station.<br><br>
The second jam didn't have a theme so we stuck with taboo and made a game about staying tipsy by drinking beer, wine, cocktails, vodka shots or water. I was responsible for writing the code, while my teammates made the art and animations. The highlight for me was making the character's animations respond to the number of drinks you had.`>}}
