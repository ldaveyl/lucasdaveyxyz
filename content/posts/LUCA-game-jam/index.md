{{< grid_words text=`A game jam is an event where participants try to make a game from scratch in limited time. I participated in 2 game jams hosted by LUCA school of arts. For the first jam, the theme was "taboo", so we made a game about kidnapping: you drive around in a white van, luring little Kennies from South Park with candy, and then bring them home (trust me, this was mild compared to the competition). There are police cars patrolling around, and you can top up on candy at the gas station. I really enjoyed working on the "AI" (i.e. if see candy -> walk to candy) to lure the kids.<br><br>
The second jam didn't have a theme so we stuck with taboo and made a game about drinking alcohol 😎. The goal of the game is to stay tipsy - not too drunk or too sober - by drinking water, beers, cocktails, ... which slide towards you from the bar. Each beverage contributes to your alcohol meter, and the longer the game goes, the faster the drinksgo so you have to be very quick. To make the game extra spicy, you play as a little girl. As I had experience with coding, I was responsible for putting together the project, while my teammates made the art and animations. The highlight for me was programatically making the animations for the little girl respond to the alcohol meter.`>}}
