{{< grid_words text="These renders were made for a Reddit competition with the prompt \"Pirate\". This was my first render where I used geometry nodes, a system in Blender where you can use math to create a 3D mesh. Here, I used it to scatter barnacles on top of the treasure chest. I also spent a lot of time on the planks to make sure that the texture was different on all of them. Lastly, I also experimented with different camera angles by randomizing the placement of the camera. This gave me some weird, but interesting shots. The chest is supposed to be underwater, but I didn't capture that look, and I think the main thing that is missing is fogginess. Overall, I am still happy with how it turned out.">}}
